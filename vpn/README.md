### Start VPN Server on the Luftballon

1. Install dependencies

1. To create a Master Certificate Authority and a Server Certificate, run the command './makeVPNServer.sh'.

   ```
   ./makeVPNServer.sh <ballonName> ['default'|'proxy']
   ```

   The balloonName corresponds to the associated IP address.  
   The balloonName is a required variable.

   The second argument is optional.  
   It determines the mode of the VPN.  
   The current options are 'default' or 'proxy'.  
   Without this argument, the default mode is selected.

1. To start the VPN server on Luftballon, ensure that Luftballon is accessible and then run the command `./executeScriptOnRemoteServer.sh`.

   ```
   ./executeScriptOnRemoteServer.sh <ballonName> ['default'|'proxy']
   ```

   The balloonName corresponds to the associated IP address.  
   The balloonName is a required variable.

   The second argument is optional.  
   It determines the mode of the VPN.

### Start VPN Client Server

   ```
   ./makeVPNClient.sh <ballonName> ['default'|'proxy']

   Do you want to start the OpenVPN client on this machine?.
   ```

   This will generate the client certificate and start the client server.
